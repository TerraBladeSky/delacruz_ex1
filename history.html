  <h1>History of Roguelike Games</h1>
  
  <div class="content-section">
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>The roguelike genre began in 1980 with the creation of <b>Rogue</b> by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman. It introduced dungeon crawling with procedural generation, permadeath, and turn-based gameplay. At the time, Rogue's ASCII graphics were not a limitation but a feature, offering incredible depth for the era.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>In the years that followed, new roguelikes emerged that built upon Rogue's foundation. <i>NetHack</i> (1987) added more complexity, such as deeper interactions with the game world. <i>ADOM</i> (Ancient Domains of Mystery) introduced character development and multiple endings, while <i>Angband</i> became known for its vast dungeon levels and Tolkien-inspired lore.</p>
    </div>
    
    <blockquote>
      "We didn't think we were creating a genre—we were just making a fun game." — Glenn Wichman, Rogue co-creator
    </blockquote>
    
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>The community around these games grew, and fans began to catalog what exactly made a game a "roguelike." This led to the development of the "Berlin Interpretation" in 2008, a set of criteria used to classify roguelikes, such as randomness, turn-based play, and resource management.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>In the 2010s, indie developers began experimenting with the formula. <b>Spelunky</b> (2008) and <b>The Binding of Isaac</b> (2011) introduced action elements and real-time gameplay. These games sparked the rise of the "roguelite"—a looser interpretation of the classic formula, focused on accessibility and replay value.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="featured-game">
      <p><strong>Dead Cells</strong> (2018) represents the pinnacle of this evolution, combining Metroidvania-style exploration with roguelike elements. As our top recommended roguelike, Dead Cells perfected the formula of permanent progression through "cells" collected during runs, allowing players to unlock new abilities and weapons even after death. This brilliant system has inspired countless games since.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>The genre further evolved with games like <strong>Risk of Rain 2</strong> (2019), which successfully translated the 2D roguelike formula into a thrilling 3D experience. Its innovative approach to difficulty scaling—where the challenge increases with time—creates a unique risk-reward dynamic that has become a staple of modern roguelikes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="featured-game">
      <p><strong>Hades</strong> (2020) by Supergiant Games achieved what many thought impossible: seamlessly blending roguelike mechanics with compelling narrative. By making each run part of the story, Hades demonstrated that roguelikes could deliver emotional, character-driven experiences without sacrificing the core gameplay loop that defines the genre.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>The genre has also expanded beyond traditional action games. <strong>BlazBlue Entropy Effect</strong> merged fighting game mechanics with roguelike progression, while card-based roguelikes like <strong>Balatro</strong> prove that the genre's principles can successfully blend with other gameplay styles to create fresh experiences.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>Despite changes, core roguelikes like <i>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</i> and <i>Dwarf Fortress</i> remain popular among purists. These titles continue to push the envelope in terms of complexity and depth, reinforcing the genre's legacy in the gaming world.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <p>Over the decades, roguelikes have gone from obscure UNIX curiosities to celebrated indie staples. Their design principles have influenced games across all genres, from shooters to strategy games. The future remains bright as new developers continue to explore and expand the boundaries of the genre.</p>
