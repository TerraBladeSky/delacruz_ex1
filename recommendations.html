  <h1>My Favorite Roguelike Games</h1>
  
  <p>Welcome to my personal recommendations page! As a roguelike enthusiast, I've compiled a list of my favorite games in this genre. Each one offers something unique while maintaining the core roguelike elements that make these games so addictive and replayable. If you're looking to dive into the world of roguelikes, these titles are excellent starting points.</p>

  <h2>My Top 5 Roguelikes (Ranked)</h2>
  <ol class="game-ranking">
    <li>Dead Cells</li>
    <li>Risk of Rain 2</li>
    <li>Hades</li>
    <li>BlazBlue Entropy Effect</li>
    <li>Balatro</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="game-container">
    <h2>1. Dead Cells</h2>
    <div class="game-info">
      <img src="deadcells.jpg" alt="Dead Cells Game Screenshot" class="game-image">
      <div class="rating">★★★★★ (5/5)</div>
      <p><strong>Dead Cells</strong> is a masterclass in roguelite design, blending precise Metroidvania-style combat with procedurally generated levels. The fluid movement mechanics and responsive controls make every run feel satisfying, even when you die repeatedly. What sets Dead Cells apart is its brilliant progression system—cells collected during runs can be invested in permanent upgrades, making each failure feel like a step forward.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "The combat feels electric—every dodge, parry, and attack has weight and consequence. It's the rare game where dying doesn't feel frustrating but instead pushes you to try 'just one more run.'"
      </blockquote>
      <p>The variety of weapons and build options is staggering, allowing for countless playstyles. Whether you prefer ranged combat, melee brutality, or tactical traps, Dead Cells accommodates your approach while challenging you to adapt. With regular updates adding new content years after release, it remains one of the most polished and content-rich roguelikes available.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="game-container">
    <h2>2. Risk of Rain 2</h2>
    <div class="game-info">
      <img src="riskofrain.jpg" alt="Risk of Rain 2 Screenshot" class="game-image">
      <div class="rating">★★★★★ (5/5)</div>
      <p><strong>Risk of Rain 2</strong> successfully translated the beloved 2D roguelike into a thrilling 3D third-person shooter without losing any of the original's chaotic charm. The game's brilliant risk-reward system—where difficulty increases with time—creates a constant tension between exploring for items and rushing to the next stage.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Few games capture the joy of becoming absurdly powerful quite like Risk of Rain 2. Watching your character transform from vulnerable survivor to screen-filling harbinger of destruction is endlessly satisfying."
      </blockquote>
      <p>With over a dozen unique survivors to unlock, each with their own playstyle, and hundreds of items that can stack in unexpected ways, no two runs ever feel the same. The game excels at creating memorable moments when item combinations result in hilariously overpowered builds. The atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the alien environments, and the cooperative multiplayer allows you to share the chaos with friends, adding another layer of strategic depth.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="game-container">
    <h2>3. Hades</h2>
    <div class="game-info">
      <img src="hades.jpg" alt="Hades Game Screenshot" class="game-image">
      <div class="rating">★★★★★ (5/5)</div>
      <p><strong>Hades</strong> redefined what a roguelike narrative could be. While most games in the genre treat story as secondary to gameplay, Supergiant Games created a masterpiece where both elements enhance each other. Playing as Zagreus, son of Hades, each failed escape attempt from the underworld advances relationships with the colorful cast of Greek mythological characters.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Hades achieves the seemingly impossible: making failure feel meaningful and rewarding. The way the narrative unfolds through repeated runs transforms what could be frustration into curiosity about what new dialogue or story beat awaits after death."
      </blockquote>
      <p>The combat is equally impressive, with four distinct weapons that can be further customized with aspects, and a brilliant boon system that lets you mix powers from different Olympian gods. The attention to detail in both art and gameplay creates an immersive experience that remains fresh even after dozens of hours. Hades proves that roguelikes can deliver emotional, character-driven stories without sacrificing mechanical depth.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="game-container">
    <h2>4. BlazBlue Entropy Effect</h2>
    <div class="game-info">
      <img src="blazblue.jpg" alt="BlazBlue Entropy Effect Screenshot" class="game-image">
      <div class="rating">★★★★☆ (4/5)</div>
      <p><strong>BlazBlue Entropy Effect</strong> takes the fighting game franchise in an exciting roguelike direction. Combining the series' signature anime-inspired visuals and fast-paced combat with procedural generation creates an intriguing fusion. Each run allows you to build your character differently, experimenting with various BlazBlue characters' abilities and fighting styles.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "The depth of combat systems from BlazBlue translates surprisingly well to the roguelike format. Mastering combos and special moves feels rewarding, especially when you discover powerful synergies between different abilities."
      </blockquote>
      <p>The game shines in its variety of encounters and boss battles, though it can occasionally feel overwhelming for newcomers to the BlazBlue universe. The learning curve is steep, but the satisfaction of executing perfect combos while navigating procedurally generated challenges makes it worth persevering through the initial difficulty.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="game-container">
    <h2>5. Balatro</h2>
    <div class="game-info">
      <img src="balatro.jpg" alt="Balatro Game Screenshot" class="game-image">
      <div class="rating">★★★★☆ (4.5/5)</div>
      <p><strong>Balatro</strong> proves that roguelikes can thrive in unexpected genres. This poker-inspired deck builder takes the familiar concept of poker hands and transforms it into a strategic roguelike experience. The brilliant twist is that you're not playing traditional poker—instead, you're building hands that score points according to poker rules, then using those points to defeat increasingly difficult challenges.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Balatro's genius lies in how it takes familiar poker concepts and twists them into something entirely new. Even if you don't know poker well, the game teaches you its systems gradually while constantly introducing new strategic possibilities."
      </blockquote>
      <p>The game's minimalist visuals and smooth interface make it easy to pick up, but the depth of strategy emerges as you discover joker cards and rare modifiers that completely change how you approach building your deck. The way Balatro balances randomness with strategic choice makes each run feel unique while still rewarding skillful play. It's a perfect example of how roguelike principles can successfully blend with other genres to create something fresh and addictive.</p>
